            "longtext": "As CEO and founder of the Opquast project, I called on R√©mi Huguet for almost the whole of 2020. The technical situation of the company before R√©mi's mission was as follows: \n - a significant technical debt , \n- a very heavy and not very scalable legacy code, \n- a very invested technical team but which suffered more than it accommodated the requests for evolutions and functionalities \n- a complex service architecture \n- Insufficient scalability \n- Long development times \n- Applications that are too fragile \nI am not ashamed to present such a table, because I know that it is very frequent, even a little normal in the companies of the sector. \n That said, staying in a state of this type is not however possible if we want to develop, improve our agility, work faster, welcome more customers, ensure that the development teams are happy to work and informed of best practices and STATE OF THE ART. \n Having known R√©mi for several years, I asked him to tackle all these topics head-on. Throughout 2020, R√©mi worked with the developer teams and with the rest of the teams. He alternated between basic projects and much faster interventions. He organized workshops with developers and fundamentally changed the way the company works, its architecture, and its technological choices. For my part, I also had to make some major choices, but I think I can say that neither I nor my teams were abrupt or constrained during this period. R√©mi has shown exceptional listening and adaptability, being able to move with ease from a strategic worksite to an urgent bugfixing site to supplement the team when needed. In short, R√©mi is a very valuable resource, with excellent listening and adapting skills. His intervention with a team is at least useful and at least as far as Opquast is concerned, has been extremely profitable. \nThis rave board would only be of value if it also mentioned weaknesses: I will mention two, one little tendency to abuse gifs and its backhand in table tennis."

            "longtext": "Convinced of the merits of functional tests and the TDD approach for many years, the helpless technical team could never pass the implementation stage for the main reason: methodology! \n What to test ? How to test it? Up to what level? The wall seemed insurmountable, no verification seemed possible without calling on the database and a lot of testing, constant frustration, hell. (Our app is 11 years old.) \n For many years as a good student and good soldier we have followed two perilous paths, that of the Merise method and the acceptance of ORM as the cornerstone of any good web project. It's reassuring, but there are limits. \n There are meetings that we know are important, that we sometimes hope for, and that we are blessed for having arrived. R√©mi's is saving in many respects. \n R√©mi's meeting is part of an important step, which, not content with having improved my own development practices, has greatly consolidated the quality of production and the resilience of the Opquast technical team. \n R√©mi, endowed with an incredible benevolence, has the rare capacity to immediately understand your project, your module, your code, to draw out its weaknesses, to foresee the axes of improvement. R√©mi accompanies you and takes you to review your thought patterns, invites you to ask yourself the right questions to meet the functional needs of your users. It seems obvious said like that, but the technical prism very often absorbs us. \n R√©mi masters the technique, Django with us, the concepts, a large part of the design patterns but his professional experience allows him to always offer support and training, enlightened never dogmatic, a real happiness. \n I think you understood it, like a queen in a game of chess, R√©mi is a quality resource to help your technical teams grow. \n PS: For lack of humor he prefers to communicate by gif, sometimes of several mega bytes, in short ecology is not his domain."
