## [Typed functional dependency injection in python](https://sobolevn.me/2020/02/typed-functional-dependency-injection)

Dependency injection is a base technique for successfully decoupling architectures. The functional programming style is a source of inspiration and elegant pattern to improve the code. Static typing makes the business code more robust and expressive.

This article brilliantly presents how to use functional typed dependency injection , as part of a web application using Django.

## [Never use the word “User” in your code](https://codewithoutrules.com/2018/09/21/users-considered-harmful/)

Naming is a crucial design element for software - and particularly difficult. Language alignment is central in Domain Drive Design in particular. A case study, which we have all come across at one time or another, is well exposed here. There is no "User" in your software!
