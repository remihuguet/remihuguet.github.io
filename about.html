                <strong>Software developer, entrepreneur.</strong><br/>
                I'm currently lead developer at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.eshard.com/">eshard</a> where I help to build esdynamic, our web-based security analysis platform dedicated to security experts.

        <p>
            I'm 36, leaving near Bordeaux, France, with my beloved son and wife Marie-Hélène ( see <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mon-horizon.com">Mon Horizon</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
            Graduate in physics, I began to be a developper during my PhD, making some ugly Fortran code to build nuclear matter models based on subnucleonic constituents. 
            For the braves: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theses.fr/2008BOR13604">thesis</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://arxiv.org/find/nucl-th/1/au:+Huguet_R/0/1/0/all/0/1">publications</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since 2008, I design and develop software. 
        </p>
        <p>
            After a first position as a software developer and team leader at Logica (now CGI) between 2008 and 2011, I have been a partner, developer, consultant, team lead, and many more things at Tiki Move, as small consultancy specialised in mobile development.
            In 2014, Tiki Move became a part of <a href="https://www.clever-age.com/fr/" target="_blank">Clever Age</a> and I led the integration process.
        </p>
        <p> In 2015, I joined <a target="_blank" href="https://www.actiwine.com">Actiwine</a> at the beginning. The goal of Actiwine is to help wine professional selling and buying wines. I build our web marketplace, recruit the product team.</p>
    <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>
            I build software to improve the daily lives of users, organizations and create new dynamics of value creation.
        </p>
        <p>
            I promote a work organisation based on empathy, autonomy, trust, personal responsibility,  and high requirement.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm constantly looking for learning and extending my confort zone. I contribute to the sharing of experiences and knowledge to promote the improvement of all.
